##  Overview

This work presents a systematic numerical investigation of add–drop microring resonators based on lead-free Cs₃Cu₂Cl₅ embedded in SiO₂ cladding.

Using full-vectorial FDTD simulations, the influence of key geometric parameters—including:

- Ring width  
- Coupling gap  
- Ring radius  

is examined to establish quantitative geometry–performance relationships.

Resonance metrics extracted:

- Q-factor  
- Free Spectral Range (FSR)  
- Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM)  
- Extinction Ratio  
- Insertion Loss  
- Finesse  

The study identifies transitions between over-coupled, critically coupled, and under-coupled regimes and clarifies design trade-offs.
